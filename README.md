# Project Background

You will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

### Steps done:

1. Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Requests/Splinter, Selenium, and Python modules for regular expressions and time.
2. Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page (using Bootstrap) that displays all of the information that was scraped from the various URLs related to the Mission to Mars.
